   - **Tools**: YOLO (You Only Look Once), TensorFlow, Keras
   - **Dataset**: COCO (Common Objects in Context)
   - **Description**: Implement an object detection algorithm like YOLO or SSD that can identify and classify multiple objects (like people, cars, animals) in an image with bounding boxes.

4. **Color Detection**
   - **Goal**: Identify and label colors in an image.
   - **Tools**: OpenCV, Python
   - **Dataset**: Any set of color-labeled images or your own collection.
   - **Description**: Implement a color detection system that can identify dominant colors in an image and label them. This can be useful in building color-themed apps (e.g., detecting the color of a car, furniture, etc.).

5. **Handwritten Digit Recognition**
   - **Goal**: Recognize handwritten digits using a machine learning model.
   - **Tools**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
   - **Dataset**: MNIST
